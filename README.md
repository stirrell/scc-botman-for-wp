# scc-botman-for-wp
This is a simple WordPress plugin that wraps up the web widget provided by BotMan (https://botman.io/) to interact with the BotMan chatbot. Activating the plugin will load the needed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additonally, under the WordPress Settings menu in the Dashboard, there will be an option for "BotMan Widget Options." You can set options for the widget here. Many of these options are described in the BotMan documentation:

https://botman.io/2.0/web-widget#configuration

I set defaults for most of the options but a URL for the chat server is required. So an instance of BotMan will have to be set up and publically available to use with this plugin.
